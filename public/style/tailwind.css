       and just import it. However, Tailwind usually wants to be the source of truth.
       For now, we successfully mapped them in tailwind.config.js so we can keep 
       variables.css loaded separately OR import it here. 
       Let's keep variables.css separate in layout to avoid breaking everything at once, 
       but ideally we eventually move them here.
